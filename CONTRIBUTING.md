## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available documentation.

If you have a question feel free to reach out to the team:
- Write a question in the team Slack channel **pup-team**
  - Provide as much context as you can.
  - Provide project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant.

If you don't get the wanted response in Slack, try to reach out to one of the team members personally. 
We do encourage the use of our public team channel, to keep communication stream-lined and public.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. 
Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. 
Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the documentation. If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there are related questions in our team Slack channel **pup-team**.
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <>.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Use the contribure-pr-template when create a PR to the project.
  - Please be sure to fill out the template with the related information, to insure a 
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots or screen recordings** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and the built-in [screen recorder in GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en) or [SimpleScreenRecorder](https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most PuP users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
