## I have a question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available documentation.

If you have a question feel free to reach out to the team:
- Write a question in the team Slack channel **pup-team**
  - Provide as much context as you can.
  - Provide project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant.

If you don't get the wanted response in Slack, try to reach out to one of the team members personally. 
We do encourage the use of our public team channel, to keep communication stream-lined and public.

## I want to contribute
Before contributing we highly recommend to read our [Way of Code](WAY_OF_CODE.md).
It will tell you have we structure our code. What testing strategy we follow and similar.
We don't expect you to have the full knowledge of what is written there, but it will help you with a foundation to build on.

### Reporting bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before submitting a bug report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. 
Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. 
Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the documentation. If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there are related questions in our team Slack channel **pup-team**.
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to [PUP security email](mailto:i4k4e5m0w6w5n4e4@jppol.slack.com?subject=Security Issue:).

### Suggesting features

This section guides you through submitting a feature suggestion for PUP, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. 
Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the team to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before submitting an enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the documentation carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.

#### How do I submit a good enhancement suggestion?

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Please be sure to fill out the template with the related information. It makes it easier for the PUP team to review and evaluate your changes.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
